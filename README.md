Streamline your writing in Jekyll with some commands.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-compose.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-compose)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jekyll-compose', group: [:jekyll_plugins]

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

After you have installed (see above), run `bundle exec jekyll help` and you should see:

Listed in help you will see new commands available to you:

```sh
  draft      # Creates a new draft post with the given NAME
  post       # Creates a new post with the given NAME
  publish    # Moves a draft into the _posts directory and sets the date
  unpublish  # Moves a post back into the _drafts directory
  page       # Creates a new page with the given NAME
```

Create your new page using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll page "My New Page"

Create your new post using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll post "My New Post"

Create your new draft using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll draft "My new draft"

Publish your draft using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/my-new-draft.md
    # or specify a specific date on which to publish it
    $ bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/my-new-draft.md --date 2014-01-24

Unpublish your post using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll unpublish _posts/2014-01-24-my-new-draft.md

## Configuration

To customize the default plugin configuration edit the `jekyll_compose` section within your jekyll config file.

```
  jekyll_compose:
    auto_open: true
```

and make sure that you have `EDITOR` or `JEKYLL_EDITOR` environment variable set.

The latter one will override default `EDITOR` value.

It will open a newly generated post in your selected editor.
